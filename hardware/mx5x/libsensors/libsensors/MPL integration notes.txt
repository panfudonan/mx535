Notes on integrating InvenSense MPL with Gingerbread
----------------------------------------------------
VERSION : 3.4.0

First things: Make sure the platform is properly set up
   -- Modify the kernel to include the MPU3050 driver
     -- Be aware that the MPU3050 driver introduces kernel defines that may conflict with existing drivers
       -- AK8975 in particular
     -- Double check the bus attachment for the compass and the MPU
     -- Double check the mounting matrices
   -- Check that the modified kernel boots and that /dev/mpu and /dev/mpuirq and /dev/accelirq exist and have usable permissions
   -- Run the driver selftest to confirm that the driver is working and i2c traffic to the mpu works 

   -- MPL libraries are *processor specific*.  This was a problem for us, as we tried to run a Nexus1 lib on the Ventana platform and the two processors do not have the same FPU.


The HAL implementation InvenSense provides for Gingerbread is derived from the implementation 
provided by Google for NexusS (crespo). A comparison of the InvenSense code and the original Google
code will be very instructive, especially as regards using additional sensors (like light and pressure).

Any existing HAL implementations need to be disabled.  Check in vendor/ directories as well as the device/ subtree.

To install the InvenSense implementation:
  1) Copy the provided vendor/invensense directory to your Android tree.
  2) Modify Android.mk in vendor/invensense/libsensors to generate a sensors.[platform].so appropriate for your platform.
  3) Copy (or link) the appropriate MPL shared libraries into vendor/invensense/libsensors.
  4) Copy or link the MPL headers under vendor/invensense/libsensors.
     -or-
     Modify the Android.mk in vendor/invensense/libsensors to point to the installed MPL headers on your system.

  5) Run mmm -B vendor/invensense 
  6) Run make (to regenerate the .img files).
  7) Update the flash or system disk for your platform using the new img files.


The FroYo version of the MPL integration included additional APIs (not specified by Google) which allowed Java apps
to call MPL management functions.  These APIs are available on Gingerbread via the SysApi class.  Java code for this class
is included with the RollDice app.  The Java code needs to be added to any project which requires access to the SysApi functions.

As of version 3.3, a gestures extension is also included with the Gingerbread Sensor Manager package.  This extension is not an offical
Android api, but does attempt to mimic the sensors API.  The implementation of the gesture extension places limitations on integrating
other sensors (such as light and pressure).  The MPL and its sensors claim IDs 0-16.  No other sensors are allowed to use these IDs.

Additionally, the MPL may make use of several file handles including /dev/mpu, /dev/mpuirq, /dev/accelirq, /dev/compassirq, and /dev/timerirq.
These filehandles must have appropriate permissions after boot.  Also note that there is some special handling in sensros_mpl for the multiple
file handles.
